I made this app to test MVVM app architecture, creating collection views, and using the Rick and Morty API.
The files that show the Model  from MVVM is the CharacterSource.swift, Origin.swift, Location.swift, and Repository.swift files. The files that represent the viewmodel from MVVM is the ViewModel.swift.  The files that represent the view from MVVM is the ViewController.swift and Cell.swift files
